Hello, this is Izzan.

I am a research assistant at Monash University, Indonesia under Associate Professor [Derry Wijaya](https://www.monash.edu/indonesia/about/academic-staff/derry-wijaya). I obtained my Bachelor of Science in Mathematics from Institut Teknologi Bandung (ITB) in 2021 at the age of 18.

My research interests consists of multilinguality, preference tuning, computational social science, and yeah tbh the range is pretty wide.
