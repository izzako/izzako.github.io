Since I have a wide range of interests outside of research *as well*, Iâ€™ll divide them into two categories: outdoor activities and creative hobbies.

For outdoor activities, I enjoy hiking, working out, running, ice skating, playing billiards, and bouldering.

As for creative hobbies, I can play instruments like piano and guitar. Sometimes, I also explore sound engineering, including mixing, mastering, and music production. I also enjoy drawing, both traditionally (sketches) or digital painting.
